# Cat Painting | FCC Responsive Web Design Certification

**Project 12/20**

A fully CSS-drawn cat head illustration 😺 built using only HTML and CSS. Every part of the cat — from ears to whiskers — is crafted with pure CSS properties like `border`, `transform`, and `border-radius`. This project focuses on precision, creativity, and mastering positioning techniques.
