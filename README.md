### 🎓 What I Learned

**In Precess!**

  > 🚀 For me, this project was more about **practice** and gaining additional **experience**,  
  > rather than learning something entirely new.  
  >  
  > 👨‍💻 Since I’m not a beginner and already familiar with these technologies,  
  > I approached it with confidence — and still, I truly **enjoyed working on it**.  
  >  
  > 🎯 Overall, I consider this a very **valuable and enjoyable experience**.
